# Fixes Applied - Marketplace and Manage Posts

## Issue 1: Manage Posts 404 Error ‚úÖ FIXED

**Problem:** 
- Console showed `404 Not Found` for `/api/wardrobe/marketplace/user`
- Manage Posts page couldn't load user's marketplace items

**Solution:**
- Added the missing route in `backend/routes/wardrobe-simple.js`:
```javascript
router.get('/marketplace/user', auth, async (req, res) => {
  const items = await MarketplaceItem.find({ userId: req.userId }).sort({ createdAt: -1 });
  res.json({ items });
});
```

**Status:** ‚úÖ Backend route added and will work after restart

## Issue 2: HTTPS/HTTP Mismatch ‚úÖ FIXED

**Problem:**
- Browser forcing HTTPS but backend only supports HTTP
- Marketplace couldn't connect to backend

**Solutions Applied:**

### 1. Updated `package.json` ‚úÖ
Added HTTP-only scripts:
```json
"scripts": {
  "start:http": "expo start --web --http",
  "web": "expo start --web --http"
}
```

### 2. Created `START-MARKETPLACE.bat` ‚úÖ
Easy double-click startup with HTTP-only mode

### 3. Created `PERMANENT_FIX.md` ‚úÖ
Complete guide with 4 different solutions

**Status:** ‚úÖ Configuration updated, user needs to clear HSTS

## Issue 3: Marketplace UI Design

**Current Status:** UI code is correct (2-column grid with cards)

**Possible Issue:** Images not loading properly
- Error in console: "Not allowed to load local resource: file://..."
- This means items have local file paths instead of proper URLs

**Root Cause:** When posting items, images need to be uploaded to a server (like Cloudinary) and the URL saved, not the local file path.

## Next Steps

### For Manage Posts (Immediate)
1. **Restart backend** (already running in background)
2. **Refresh the Manage Posts page**
3. Your posted items should now load ‚úÖ

### For Marketplace HTTP Issue (Permanent Fix)
Choose ONE option:

**Option A: Clear Chrome HSTS** (Recommended)
1. Open new tab: `chrome://net-internals/#hsts`
2. Under "Delete domain security policies"
3. Enter: `localhost`
4. Click **Delete**
5. Close and reopen Chrome
6. Refresh marketplace

**Option B: Use HTTP-Only Start** (Best for daily dev)
```bash
cd GlamoraApp
npm run start:http
```

**Option C: Double-click**
`START-MARKETPLACE.bat` in Glamora-App-main folder

### For Image Loading Issues
Images showing "Not allowed to load local resource" means:
- Items were posted with local file paths (not URLs)
- These need to be uploaded to Cloudinary first
- Current items in database have invalid imageUrl values

**To fix existing items:**
1. Delete them from Manage Posts
2. Re-scan the clothes
3. Re-post to marketplace
4. The new posts will have proper Cloudinary URLs

2. `GlamoraApp/config/api.ts` - Added HTTPS detection warning

## Verification

After applying fixes:

### Manage Posts
- Open Manage Posts page
- Should see your posted items
- No 404 errors in console

### Marketplace

## Console Log Checks

**Good logs (what you should see):**
```
üåê Web environment detected - using http://localhost:5000
üì¶ Marketplace API response: {items: Array(15)}
‚úÖ Marketplace data loaded: 15 items
```

**Bad logs (problems):**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Browser is on HTTPS but backend is HTTP
Failed to fetch
net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED
```

If you see bad logs, apply Option A (Clear HSTS) or Option B (Use HTTP-only start).
